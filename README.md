# Srcery Theme

Srcery theme for Visual Studio Code, based on
[srcery-colors/srcery-vim](https://github.com/srcery-colors/srcery-vim)

I made this for my personal use, so I do not intend to follow closely what
srcery-colors does. I did start this colorscheme from their colours, so it is
only doing them justice to have the string in the name of the package.

I invite you to go to [srcery-colors](https://github.com/srcery-colors) profile
to see more orthodox implementations of the theme.

## Install

Search for the `Srcery` theme in the marketplace
